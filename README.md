# Polynom

## descreption
This project represents monomial, polynomial with many functions and operations
### Monom class
Use a monom from the format of a*x^b.
```
   Note: We assumed that the input is valid
   a*x^b
```
The class monom supports some functions as
- add
- derivative
- f(x)
- multiply
- is equal
- is zero
### Polynom class
Use a ploynom from the format of a*x1^b + a*x2^b + .... + a*xn^b.
```
   Note: We assumed that the input is valid
   a*x1^b + a*x2^b + .... + a*xn^b
```
The class polynom supports some functions as:
- add - there is two options to add function add Monom/Polynom(useing Polynom_able) . 
- derivative 
- f(x)
- multiply 
- subtract 
- root
- copy area
- is equal 
- is zero
### Example run
In the RunningExample class there are examples of Polynom and Monom functions
,You can run and see the examples , you can plot a graph 2D with the RunningExampleGraph class(gral jar - there is a link to gral GitHub).
have fun .
